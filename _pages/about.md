I am a Lead Engineer Power Electronics at [Eaton Research Labs (ERL)](https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/company/research-and-development.html), located in Menomonee Falls, WI, USA. I obtained my Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees from the Spellman High Voltage Power Electronics Laboratory (SHVPEL) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu) in 2022 and 2024, respectively, under the guidance of [Prof. Fang Luo](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/electrical/people/-core_faculty/luo_fang). I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering with Honours from the [University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore](https://www.uet.edu.pk/home/) in Lahore, Pakistan in 2018.

During my Ph.D., I worked as a research intern in Summer 2022 at GE Aerospace Research (then GE Research), focusing on Hybrid Electric Propulsion. Prior to pursuing Ph.D., I worked as a Site Engineer with the Pak Matiari - Lahore Transmission Company Private Limited/China Electric Power Equipment and Technology, State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) on the [±660 kV HVDC transmission line project](https://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/17) in Pakistan. Earlier in my career, I served as a Research Analyst with [Power Technology Research](https://ptr.inc), where I did market research for developing transformer cost models.


Research Interests
-----
I am interested in modular heterogeneous integrated architectures for Wide Bandgap (WBG) and Ultra-Wide Bandgap (UWBG)-based power converters as we advance toward "Power Electronics 3.0", driven by the challenges of an aging electric grid, rising industrial power demands, the growth of AI/ML data centers, and the electrification of transportation. Heterogeneous packaging is a multi-physics domain that encompasses electrical, mechanical, thermal, and embedded system design aspects. My primary focus is on the electro-thermal co-design and embedded system aspects.

For the electro-thermal co-design aspect, I am interested in addressing the exacerbated side effects of fast switching ($$\text{d}v/\text{d}t$$ and $$\text{d}i/\text{d}t$$), such as Partial Discharge (PD), Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and high-frequency interactions, with the overarching goal of achieving high-power density for heterogeneously integrated power converters. My focus is on high-fidelity modeling of these phenomena and on identifying packaging architectures, along with active and passive techniques that account for mechanical and thermal constraints. Additionally, I am interested in integrated magnetic structures that provide both Common Mode (CM) and Differential Mode (DM) inductances.

In the realm of embedded systems, I am focused on non-invasive health monitoring of power converters. As switching frequencies increase and enter the "MHz" territory, the pool of available voltage and current sensing technologies is expensive and limited, rendering purely physics-based health prognostics and diagnostics impractical. Consequently, I am interested in developing hybrid approaches combining physics-based modeling with data-driven techniques, such as multi-time-scale Digital Twin.
