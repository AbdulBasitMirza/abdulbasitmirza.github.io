I am a Lead Power Electronics Engineer at [Eaton Research Labs (ERL)](https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/company/research-and-development.html), located in Menomonee Falls, WI, USA. I obtained my Ph.D. and Master's degrees from the Spellman High Voltage Power Electroncis Laboratory (SHVPEL) at the [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), where I was advised by [Prof. Fang Luo](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/electrical/people/-core_faculty/luo_fang). I previously obtained my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering with Honours from [University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore](https://www.uet.edu.pk/home/) in Lahore, Pakistan.

During my Ph.D., I worked as a research intern in Summer 2022 at GE Aerospace Research (formerly known as GE Research). 

Research Interests
-----

I'm interested in the creation of versatile, intelligent, embodied agents that learn to better interact with the world by accumulating knowledge over their lifetimes. I focus on the question of how these agents can leverage various forms of compositional and modular structures to transform the complex problem of modeling a lifelong data stream into simpler problems that can be more easily solved and whose solutions can be adapted, recombined, and reused in the future. My work mainly applies these methods to robotics, and also engages with related fields like computer vision and natural language.
