I received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (power) with honours from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan in 2018. I received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA, in 2022 and 2024, respectively. I am currently working as a Lead Engineer Power Electronics at Eaton Research Labs, Menomonee Falls, WI, USA. In 2022, I was a research intern at GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY, USA.

My research interests include system-level design and packaging of high-density and high-power converters; side effects (EMI/EMC, partial discharge, and high-frequency interactions) modeling and mitigation; integrated magnetics design and non-invasive health monitoring of power converters using Digital Twin.
