I am a Lead Power Electronics Engineer at [Eaton Research Labs (ERL)](https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/company/research-and-development.html), located in Menomonee Falls, WI, USA. I obtained my Ph.D. and Master's degrees from the Spellman High Voltage Power Electronics Laboratory (SHVPEL) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), where I was advised by [Prof. Fang Luo](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/electrical/people/-core_faculty/luo_fang). I previously obtained my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering with Honours from [University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore](https://www.uet.edu.pk/home/) in Lahore, Pakistan.

During my Ph.D., I worked as a research intern in Summer 2022 at GE Aerospace Research (formerly known as GE Research). Before embarking on Ph. D., I worked as Site Engineer with the China Electric Power Equipment and Technology (CET)/State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) on the [&pm;660 kV HVDC transmission line project](https://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/17) in Pakistan and as Research Analyst with [Power Technology Research](https://ptr.inc).

Research Interests
-----

My research interests include system-level design and packaging of high-density and high-power converters; side effects (EMI/EMC, partial discharge, and high-frequency interactions) modeling and mitigation; integrated magnetics design and non-invasive health monitoring of power converters using Digital Twin.
