abstract: 'Grid-integration of renewables through power electronic Grid-Interface Converters (GICs) is essential for achieving a sustainable grid. This mission involves developing compact, efficient converters with standardized interfaces to minimize redundancy. In line with this objective, this paper presents an electro-mechanical-thermal design and packaging of a two-stage SiC-based 75 kVA GIC using TO-247 discrete devices with two times lower cost-to-power ratio than power modules. The power stage is 3-D packaged on a cylindrical-hole-based three-face utilized heat sink to achieve 5.5 kW/L power density, including passive components. For the DC-AC stage, Two-Level Split-Phase topology (2L-SP) is employed, owing to its lower switching loss and output dv/dt and increased cross-talk immunity compared with simple Two-Level (2L) topology. An equivalent switching transition circuit is derived for optimal sizing of split inductors in 2L-SP. Further, for device interconnection, an optimized PCB layout with flux cancellation and minimum board parasitic capacitance is developed for optimal device switching with minimum voltage overshoot. Moreover, for magnetics, split-direct winding technique is employed to achieve minimum winding capacitance. Lastly, the developed GIC is systematically tested at rated system voltage with an RL load at 10 kVA.'
