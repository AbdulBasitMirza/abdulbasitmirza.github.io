abstract: 'With a vision to increase power density and standardize power electronics interface with the grid, this paper presents the design and validation of a SiC-based 75 kVA Intelligent Power Stage (IPS), comprising DC-DC and DC-AC power stages. The IPS is built on a modular 3D structure platform, where all three sides of the heat sink are utilized to achieve high power density (5.5 kW/L), including passives. The heat sink is custom-built and optimized to channel power from all three sides. Moreover, the intelligent features involve online non-invasive health monitoring of power stage components through a pseudo-optimized Digital Twin (DT) approach. DT also aids in identifying system failure modes, providing an extra layer of protection. Lastly, for grid-tie operation and interoperability, a hierarchical controller Smart Universal Power Electronics Regulator (SUPER) is proposed, which controls the DC-AC stage and monitors the health of IPS components through control and data communication channels.'
